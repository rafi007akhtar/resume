# resume

## Overview
My personal CV written in LaTeX with the help of an online template.
- Source code: [cv.tex](https://github.com/rafi007akhtar/resume/blob/master/cv.tex)
- CV PDF: [cv.pdf](https://github.com/rafi007akhtar/resume/blob/master/cv.pdf)

## Credits
As I was short in time, I had to use a template to make this file, instead of making it from scratch. <br/>
